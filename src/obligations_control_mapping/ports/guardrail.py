"""GuardrailPort: the boundary that screens a generation call in both directions (rule R1).

Rule R1 is the reason this port exists: a service that binds ``agent-guardrail-gateway`` as a
mandatory dependency must screen every inbound prompt BEFORE it reaches a model, and every
outbound answer AFTER it is produced and BEFORE it is used or returned. This service has one
generation call, the coverage narration, and ``domain/narration.py`` calls
:meth:`GuardrailPort.screen` around it in exactly that shape: the caller-supplied scope and the
prompt as sent before the generation port is called, and the model's raw text after it.

The domain stays pure. This port names the screen; the adapters (not this module) depend on the
managed guardrail service (Model Armor) or a local heuristic stand-in.

        Never raises on a policy match: a block is reported as ``GuardrailVerdict(allowed=False,
        ...)`` so the caller can audit the attempt before deciding how to fail. An allowed verdict
        carries ``sanitized_text``, the text the caller uses from then on EXACTLY as given (the
        input unchanged when nothing was redacted, possibly empty when everything was); the
        caller never falls back to the unscreened original.

        Raising is reserved for the adapter being unable to decide at all: its backend errored
        or timed out, no template is configured, or the on-prem placeholder is bound. The domain
        treats every such raise as a refusal (fail closed), audits it, and lets it propagate.
