"""GCP GenerationPort: Gemini narration (SDK imports stay lazy).

The model is used for narration only; the consequential numbers are computed by the deterministic
engine and merely restated here. The Gemini SDK import lives INSIDE the method so the
``local``/``onprem`` profiles import this module with no cloud SDK installed (the portability
proof, and the reason the managed family refuses rather than succeeds under the offline gate). The
import root is ``google.*``, which the repo's mypy override already covers.

The SDK is ``google-genai``, the unified Google GenAI SDK. It replaced ``google-generativeai``,
which is RETIRED; this module used the retired one until 2026-08-31 and the migration was not a
pin bump, because the call shape differs: a stateful ``GenerativeModel`` holding the system
instruction became a client plus a per-call ``GenerateContentConfig`` that carries it. The client
is constructed with no arguments on purpose, which is what the retired SDK also did: credentials
and backend come from the environment, so a deployment can send this at either the Gemini
Developer API or Vertex (``GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI``) without a code change here. Naming a
backend in this module would decide for every deployment something no deployment has asked us to
decide.
