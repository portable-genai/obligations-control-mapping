# FAQ index

Answers to the questions different teams ask when evaluating, adopting or reviewing this
repository as the system of record for an obligation to control graph. Each file is written for a
specific audience; skim the one that matches your role.

| FAQ | For | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| [security-faq.md](security-faq.md) | AppSec / security review | server-side identity, tenant isolation on the register, the exposure guard, secrets, supply chain, the audit chain |
| [portability-faq.md](portability-faq.md) | Architecture / cloud / exit planning | no-lock-in, the three profiles, the sovereign exit, where the graph lives |
| [features-faq.md](features-faq.md) | Product / risk / delivery | what the coverage engine computes, what the model is allowed to say, and the boundary with sibling catalog systems |
| [adoption-faq.md](adoption-faq.md) | Engineering leads forking the repo | rename, upstream fixes, extension points, what stays open |
| [compliance-faq.md](compliance-faq.md) | Compliance / model risk / second line | why a coverage figure is defensible, maker-checker, residency, retention, model-risk evidence |

These FAQs deliberately do **not** re-document capabilities owned by sibling systems in the GRC
catalog. Where a concern belongs to another repo (the regulatory corpus and change horizon `compliance-advisory`,
the guardrail gateway `agent-guardrail-gateway`, the human-review console `human-review-console`, the eval platform `model-quality-gate`), the FAQ points
at it and explains the boundary rather than duplicating it. See
[features-faq.md](features-faq.md) for the full "what this repo owns vs what it integrates" map.

Authority order for anything these pages disagree with: [`SPEC.md`](../../SPEC.md), then
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md), then [`COMPLIANCE.md`](../../COMPLIANCE.md), then
[`README.md`](../../README.md). These pages restate; they do not decide.
